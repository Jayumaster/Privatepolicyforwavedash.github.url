Thanks for clarifying — since Wave Dash is an app (not a browser game), the Privacy Policy should be mobile-app focused. That means: no social logins (as you mentioned), but also no cookies/local storage references like in a web version. Instead, it should focus on device data, analytics, crash logs, and in-app purchases. 

Here’s the updated Privacy Policy for the Wave Dash App:
